#Page4

To edit the main content on this page, locate the file named `page4.md` in the site's directory. Use GitHub's online editor or your own text editor to make changes. You can use [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) to style your text. Or you can use HTML. Feel free to rename the file using the title of your choice!

You'll need to update the related link in the side bar so people can find your new page. The side bar content can be found at `_includes/side-nav.html`.

To make life a little easier, the navbars and content pages are generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Styles and templates are from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).
