OpenReferral Workshop Website
=============================

The purpose of this repo is to host a website about OpenReferral's 2014 workshop in Oakland. 

Hosting is provided by GitHub's 'GitHub Pages' feature. And, To make life a little easier, 
the pages are generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Styles and templates are from 
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

Not sure what's going to end up here, but ideas include: 
- agendas
- links to stuff that workshop attendees may find useful
- links to Google Docs that we're collaborating on for certain things
- ...?

Feel free to pitch in! One way to suggest items for the webpage is to open an issue [here](https://github.com/openreferral/workshop/issues?labels=content+idea&page=1&state=open).

Cheers, 
Hailey
