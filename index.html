<p>
	To make life a little easier, the navbars and content pages are generated by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Styles and templates are from <a href ="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Use HTML to add content to this page. --> it's named 'index.html' in the repo. <br><br>

	Use markdown to add content to the other pages.  --> they're named 'some-name.md' in the repo. when the site is served, they'll be rendered as somename/index.html.
</p>

<p> And don't forget to replace this landing page content with real information! This is just placeholder stuff.</p>
